      <h2><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7Htnl88tDD6TldOZVpucnJLTlU">1.The Number of Female Ministers</a>
      </h2>
      <p>The number of female ministers can be an indicator of a country's gender equality. This is why Justin Trudeau
        appointed the half of his cabinet with women. I compare the number of female ministers of several
        countries (Korea, Japan, Brazil, US, Canada, UK, Spain, France, and Germany).</p>

      <h2><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7Htnl88tDD6ZlBfTV9YYUhEOGM">2. Academic Ability and College
          Enrollment by Gender </a>
      </h2>
      <p>Although young female students are not less smart than male students, their college enrollment rate is lower
        than that of male students in some countries. You will discover academic ability and college enrollment
        by gender of several countries (Korea, Japan, Brazil, US, Canada, UK, Spain, France, and Germany).
      </p>

      <h2><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7Htnl88tDD6NDQtZGZQZ2hvSkU">3. Average versus Expected Years of
          Schooling by Gender</a>
      </h2>
      <p>Another educational discrepancy between women and men is agerage years of schooling. I visually compare
        the average and the expected (or desired) years of schooling by gender of several countries (Korea, Japan,
        Brazil, US, Canada, UK, Spain, France, and Germany).
      </p>


      <h2><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7Htnl88tDD6eHRlVDNNNlZ5OVE">4. Milk Price versus Agriculture
          Income </a>
      </h2>
      <p>In South Korea, milk price is more expensive than other countries, so even milk producers cannot "buy" milk. I
        visulize how much amount of milk a farmer can buy in several countries (Korea, Japan,Brazil, US, Canada, UK,
        Spain, France, and Germany).</p>


      <h2><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7Htnl88tDD6cGlXYUM1VExXS0k">5. Work Hour versus Expected
          Income</a>
      </h2>
      <p>Work hour and wage are two basic labor rights, and Korea is known to have the longest work hour among OECD
        countries. My question is that if Koreans worked the same amount of time, how much money they would make in
        other countries.</p>


      <h2><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7Htnl88tDD6NmhIVHVTUndDNjA">6. Poverty and Social Security
          Budget</a>
      </h2>
      <p>Although poverty is a constant problem of many countries, and it is difficult to find an ultimate answer.
        However, social security systems are there to function as a bottom line for extremly impecunious population.
        In the poster, I tracked the poverty rate and social security budget of South Korea for the past few years.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note for your background: The medical insurance system of South Korea has been nationally initiated since 1977,
        and most of Korean people are required to join this program. The fee to this insurance is determined by one's
        income and real estate possesion.</p>
